# News Pipeline: Skift, PhocusWire, Google News & NYTimes Scraper

A Python-powered data pipeline that fetches the latest travel and general news articles from Skift, PhocusWire, Google News, and The New York Times, stores them in a SQLite database, and displays the 5 most recent entries in the terminal and saves them to a text file.

## Features

- Multi-source scraping: Skift, Google News, NYTimes (RSS-based), PhocusWire attempted
- Incremental loading: Avoids duplicate articles using a hash-based system
- SQLite storage: Lightweight and local database for persistence
- Modular structure: Clean, maintainable code in separate modules
- Output: Displays and writes the 5 latest articles to `output/latest_articles.txt`
- Error handling: Graceful failure for unsupported or broken feeds

## PhocusWire Status

This project attempts to fetch articles from PhocusWire, but no articles are currently returned. Possible reasons include:

- The RSS feed structure may have changed
- The site may block automated scraping
- The feed URL could be deprecated or inaccessible

The script includes logging to indicate if no articles are fetched from PhocusWire or any other source.
